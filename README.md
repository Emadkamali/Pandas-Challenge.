# PyCity Schools Analysis

This project involves the analysis of school performance and student outcomes within the PyCity School District. The analysis is conducted using Python's Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.

# Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to provide insights into various aspects of school performance and student outcomes. The analysis covers the following key areas:

- District-wide summaries
- School-level performance metrics
- Grade-level comparisons
- Impact of factors such as school spending, size, and type on academic achievement

# Result
- Efficiency in resource allocation is evident in schools with lower per-student spending, which often display higher academic performance. Despite operating with smaller budgets per student, charter schools consistently outperform district schools, indicating effective resource utilization and instructional strategies.

- Regarding school size's influence on academic success, medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) exhibit the highest academic performance, followed by small-sized schools (<1000 students), with large schools (2000-5000 students) trailing behind. Larger schools encounter difficulties in managing larger student populations and providing personalized support, resulting in comparatively lower academic achievement compared to their smaller counterparts.

- In terms of spending ranges' impact on academic performance, schools with a spending range of less than $585 per student demonstrate the most exceptional academic performance across all metrics. As spending per student increases, there is a gradual decline in academic outcomes, with schools in the $645-680 spending range showing the poorest academic performance.
